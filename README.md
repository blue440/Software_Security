Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

    A financial institution that handled accounts globally, looking to secure customer data with encryption and public/private certificates.
    
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

    Ensuring that their data was secure by building in the SHA-256 algorithm to create a 64 character hash.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

    The hardest part of the vulnerability assessment was modifying vulnerability reporting.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

    By incorporating both an encryption algorithm and ensuring secure transmission of data with SSL through HTTPS.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

    Running the code in iterations after each update. This allows for the early detection of code causing issue or failure. To check to ensure vulnerabilities were addressed I saved the old static test and ran a new one. By comparing the two I was able to verify if the changes reduced vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

    Iterative processess. By testing code function after each change to ensure proper function.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

    I would provide the full report from project two as if shows the full picture of what was learned in the course.
